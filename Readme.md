# Python OOP Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** practice repository using **Python**!  
This repo is a collection of small projects and exercises that demonstrate my understanding of OOP principles.

## What I'm Learning

I’m focusing on understanding and applying the core concepts of OOP in Python, including:

- ✅ Classes and Objects  
- ✅ Constructors (`__init__`)  
- ✅ Instance Attributes and Methods  
- ✅ The `self` keyword  
- ✅ Inheritance  
- ✅ Method Overriding (`super()`)  
- ✅ Encapsulation (via private attributes)  
- ✅ Polymorphism (shared method names in different classes)  
- ✅ Real-world modeling using code

##  Projects I've Built So Far

### 1.🎓 University Management System *(Work in Progress)*
- Manages student data, course enrollment, and exam results
- Practices class creation, lists, dicts, and function logic
- Shows real-life usage of OOP to structure complex data

### 2.🚗 Car Showroom System
- Models cars, dealerships, and inventory
- Demonstrated use of `super()` and inheritance
- Example of dynamic object behavior (e.g. adding/removing cars)

### 3. 📦 Mini OOP Examples (Concept Tests)
- Small examples testing:
  - Class creation
  - Object methods
  - Data handling
  - Constructor logic

##  What's Next?

- [ ] Finish full flow of University System:
  - [x] Add students  
  - [x] Enroll courses  
  - [x] Store exam results  
  - [x] View report cards  
  - [ ] Add teachers and departments

- [ ] Add more real-world examples (banking app, library management)
