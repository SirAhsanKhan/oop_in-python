# Python OOP Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** practice repository using **Python**!  
This repo is a collection of small projects and exercises that demonstrate my understanding of OOP principles.

## What I'm Learning

Iâ€™m focusing on understanding and applying the core concepts of OOP in Python, including:

- âœ… Classes and Objects  
- âœ… Constructors (`__init__`)  
- âœ… Instance Attributes and Methods  
- âœ… The `self` keyword  
- âœ… Inheritance  
- âœ… Method Overriding (`super()`)  
- âœ… Encapsulation (via private attributes)  
- âœ… Polymorphism (shared method names in different classes)  
- âœ… Real-world modeling using code

##  Projects I've Built So Far

### 1.ðŸŽ“ University Management System *(Work in Progress)*
- Manages student data, course enrollment, and exam results
- Practices class creation, lists, dicts, and function logic
- Shows real-life usage of OOP to structure complex data

### 2.ðŸš— Car Showroom System
- Models cars, dealerships, and inventory
- Demonstrated use of `super()` and inheritance
- Example of dynamic object behavior (e.g. adding/removing cars)

### 3. ðŸ“¦ Mini OOP Examples (Concept Tests)
- Small examples testing:
  - Class creation
  - Object methods
  - Data handling
  - Constructor logic
